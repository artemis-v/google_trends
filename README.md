# Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data

What can the popularity of search terms tell us about the world? Google Trends gives us access to the popularity of Google Search terms. Let's investigate:
  1. How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin
  2. How search volume for a hot stock like Telsa relates to that stock's price 
  3. How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States

What I can do:
  1. Make time-series data comparable by resampling and converting to the same periodicity (e.g., from daily data to monthly data).
  2. Fine-tune the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colours, and the chart's resolution.
  3. Use grids to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.
  4. Find the number of missing and NaN values and how to locate NaN values in a DataFrame.
  5. Work with Locators to better style the time axis on a chart.
